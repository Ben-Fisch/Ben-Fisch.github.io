        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ben Fischer and I am from Milwaukee, WI. I originally started my career in Sales but recently
            decided
            to try out software development.I'm currently enrolled in devCodeCamp to become a Software Developer upon
            completion of the course. When I am not learning to code I typically am reading or playing video games.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here is a current list of projects I've completed with more to come: <br>
        <div class="projects">
            <a href="https://github.com/Ben-Fisch/DayTripProj.git">Day Trip Generator</a><br>
            This project was created for the purpose of ranomly generating a trip. The generator will randomly pick a
            location, mode of transportation, restaurant and evening entertainment for the user. <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/lucaleyva/rpsls_proj.git">RPSLS</a><br>
            RPSLS stands for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock which is a version of Rock, Paper, Scissors created on
            the show The Big Bang Theory. In this project a user will be able to play a game of RPSLS versus another
            user or versus the computer which randomly selects one of the choices. <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/TylerSerrano98/soda-machine-unit-testing.git">Unit Testing</a><br>
            Here are the tests my partner and I created to test the functions for a soda machine. <br>
